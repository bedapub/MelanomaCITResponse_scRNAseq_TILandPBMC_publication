# MelanomaCITResponse_scRNAseq_TILandPBMC_publication

This repository includes notebooks utilized to produce results for the publication "Myeloid-T cell interplay, cell state transitions and checkpoint inhibitor response in melanoma":

* Standard workflow (adapted from besca 2.4, based on scanpy)
* Cell annotation workflow (adapted from besca 2.4, based on scanpy, including exploratory analyses related to signature and marker gene expression
* Velocity analysis notebooks for CD8T cell, CD4 T cell and Monocyte-macrophages
* Notebooks used to generate differential cell expression, differential cell abundance and the publication figures

The underlying count data can be retrieved from ArrayExpress, E-MTAB-13770
